Tutorial: Getting Started with SD2E CLI
-------
The following instructions will guide you through setting up the SD2E CLI. 

A "system" under [Agave API v2](https://www.agaveapi.co/) is a combination of login credentials, information about available physical resources, policy descriptions, and configuration options that combine to create an abstraction of a physical computing system. This frees end users from needing to know specific details about the actual computing environment in order to move data to the system and run computing tasks on it.
