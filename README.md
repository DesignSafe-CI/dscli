Overview
--------

Fully scriptable access to the [SD2E](https://www.sd2e.org) platform is provided via RESTful web service APIS such as Agave](https://www.agaveapi.co), [Abaco](https://useabaco.cloud), [OpenStack](https://openstack.org/), and more. using these services, it is possible to:
* Develop and run applications on HPC, Cloud, and container-based computing systems
* Integrate and orchestrate computing and data tasks via web-based events
* Manage data on SD2E and other cloud storage platforms
* Bring in third-party computing and storage resources to SD2E
* Share data and applications, even with people who aren't SD2E program participants
* Build sophisticated new applications that leverage any or all of SD2E's foundational capabilities

### Tutorials

* [Get started with SD2E CLI](docs/getting-started.md)
* [Use your first SD2E Agave application](docs/use-apps.md)
* [Use your first SD2E Reactor function](docs/use-apps.md)
* [Upload and share data at SD2E](docs/manage-data.md)
* [Discovering data sets](docs/search-data.md)
* [Create an Agave batch application for SD2E](docs/app-dev.md)
* [Create a Reactor Function-as-a-Service at SD2E](docs/fn-dev.md) 

### Report errors and get help
* SD2 Program Participants can join the #api channel at [SD2E Slack](https://sd2e.slack.com/) 
* Anyone can join [TACC.cloud Community Slack](https://slackin.tacc.cloud/) for general API platform help
* Find more in-depth technical detail at the [Agave Science-as-a-Service API](http://agaveapi.co/) home page

### Additional Guides
Over time, we will add tutorials to address more use cases, for example: working with cloud systems including Amazon Web Services, Google Compute Engine, or [NSF Jetstream](https://use.jetstream-cloud.org/); building web applications; and improving reproducible science and analysis with Docker. Here are some additional guides currently available:

* [Using an Atmosphere VM as an Agave Execution System](docs/atmo-system.md)
* [Cloning a CyVerse application to your own systems](docs/iplant-clone-app.md)
* [Using the Agave CLI to interact with various aspects of the CyVerse Cyberinfrastructure](https://github.com/wjallen/using-agave)
